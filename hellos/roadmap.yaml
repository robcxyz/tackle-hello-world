  **Better declarative hooks support**
  - Multiple inheritence model
    - OpenAPI
    - Protobuf
  - Methods

  **Cache and state**
  - Tackle is getting slow and so improvments to speed should be made
  - Store local state file of providers so that each remote call doesn't need to be fetched
    - Ability to freeze / pin providers
  - Version controlled parser
