  **Better declarative hooks support**
  - Support schema inheritance
    - Examples:
      - OpenAPI
      - Protobuf
    - Idea would be able to take a schema and create a way of calling an API with that schema in a couple lines of code.
    - Would allow making CLIs that call APIs in all yaml that are super clean

  **Help + Better Declarative CLI Support**
  - Tackle's declarative hooks were supposed to be the interface with the outside world. This has not been realized yet.
  - Would be super cool if each tackle file could have a pretty `help` screen showing all the options.

  **Cache and state**
  - Tackle is getting a little slow and will only get slower as more hooks are added
  - Store local state file of providers so that each remote call doesn't need to be fetched
    - Ability to freeze / pin providers
  - Version controlled parser
